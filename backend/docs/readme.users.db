This is a filesystem based user registration DB.

Each registered user is given a hashed (double hashed) directory under the 
"db/users" path and their data is stored there within.

Also the file "db/users/users.json" contains the USER IDs of all registered 
users as a simple string array. Manually adding an ID to this file, and not
creatign a corresponding hashed directory effectively prevents anyone from 
using that USER ID to register, while also not letting anyone logging in with
that USER ID (locks the ID). For example we lock the empty USER ID this way by
placing a "" in this file. 

Default user name: Hello
Default password: 123

For registration minimum password length required is 8 characters. This is 
enforced in login.js.

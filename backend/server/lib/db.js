 * db.js - DB driver subsystem. Supports pluggable DB drivers.

 * The following functions are available from any driver returned by the
 * getDBDriver call.
 * 
 * aysnc function init()
 * Initializes the database. Throws error if the initialization fails.
 * 
 * async function runCmd(cmd, params=[])
 * Runs the given SQL command e.g. insert, delete etc.
 * @param {string} cmd The command to run
 * @param {array} params The params for SQL
 * @return true on success, and false on error
 * 
 * async function runTransaction(cmdObjs)
 * Runs the given commands as an ACID transaction. If it returns false then
 * it would roll the transaction back automatically.
 * @param {array} cmdObjs Array of {cmd: "command_to_run", params: []} objects which will be run as a single transaction.
 * @return true on success, and false on error
 *
 * async function getQuery(cmd, params=[])
 * Runs the given query e.g. select and returns the rows from the result.
 * @param {string} cmd The command to run
 * @param {array} params The params for SQL
 * @return rows array on success, and false on error. The returned array contains row data as JSON objects.

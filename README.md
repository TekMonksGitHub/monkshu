Monkshu - The HTML5/REST/JSON/Node.js/API Enterprise Application Server - JAMStack Compliant
=============================================================================================
A complete Enterprise Application Server for Mobile apps (iOS and Android), Responsive HTML 5 Apps, and JSON API services. Consists of web container (called frontend), JSON API container (called backend), and hybrid iOS and Android app frameworks. 

Monkshu is 100% compliant with [JAMStack](https://jamstack.org) standards for modern web development. 

The plan is to produce a full Enterprise Application Sever based on Node.js, HTML5, Javascript, Android and iOS apps.

Single unified codebase, with minimum external dependencies - currently the only real major dependency is Mustache for HTML5 templating.

HTML5 + Node.js + REST + Mobile (Android/iOS) + Database (MySQL, Oracle, etc.) + Globalization (i18n) support.

Cookieless sessions supported out of the box.

Mustache.js logicless templates used, as they work with JSON objects to inflate views in a non-complicated manner,
and also allow full HTML5+CSS3 design capabilites instead of coming up with a more complicated widget framework.

* Full support for Web Components, out of the box. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components
* Full support for ECMA 6 standards
* Full support for REST API based backend
* Unified server - API runtime plus HTML5 Web Component frontend.

Monkshu - The HTML5/REST/JSON/Node.js/API Enterprise Application Server
=======================================================================
A complete Enterprise Application Server for Mobile apps (iOS and Android), Responsive HTML 5 Apps, and JSON API services. Consists of web container (called frontend), JSON API container (called backend), and hybrid iOS and Android app frameworks. 

The plan is to produce a full Enterprise Application Sever based on Node.js, HTML5, Javascript, Android and iOS apps.

Single unified codebase, with minimum external dependencies - currently the only real major dependency is Mustache for HTML5 templating.

HTML5 + Node.js + REST + Mobile (Android/iOS) + Database (MySQL, Oracle, etc. using KNEX) + Globalization (i18n) support.

Cookieless sessions supported out of the box.

Mustache.js logicless templates used, as they work with JSON objects to inflate views in a non-complicated manner,
and also allow full HTML5+CSS3 design capabilites instead of coming up with a more complicated widget framework.
